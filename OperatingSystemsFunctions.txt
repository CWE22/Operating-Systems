The macOS and iOS "Dock," which resembles a strip, is used for efficiently accessing applications on your computer.   
You can add applications to your Dock that you often use (messages, email, photos, apps, and more).
For easy access, applications that you are currently using automatically go into the DocK. 
You close an app on the Dock by selecting "quit" and remove it from the Dock by selecting "Remove From Dock."
